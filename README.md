# Data Science for Conservation

Thanks in large part to Aldo Leopold's writing, one of the seven tenets of the [North American Model of Wildlife Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Model_of_Wildlife_Conservation) is that science should form the basis for informed management and decision-making processes.

In that spirit, this repository is for data science and research projects that support and explore conservation. Each project will have its own folder, with an overview in a README file or described in the Jupyter notebook that contains the analysis.

**Projects**

- [Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF)](./LWCF/README.md)
- [Sources for Conservation Funding](./ConservationFunding/SourcesForConservationFunding.ipynb)
