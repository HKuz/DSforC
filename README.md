# Data Science for Conservation

Aldo Leopold is considered to be one of the "founding fathers" of wildlife conservation in America. Thanks in large part to his writing, one of the seven tenets of the [North American Model of Wildlife Conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Model_of_Wildlife_Conservation) is that science should form the basis for informed management and decision-making processes.

In that spirit, this repository is for data science, research projects, and analysis of conservation topics and issues. Each project will have its own folder, with a description in the respective README file or Jupyter notebook.

**Projects**

- [Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) - New England](./LWCF/README.md)
- [Sources of Conservation Funding](./ConservationFunding/SourcesForConservationFunding.ipynb)
