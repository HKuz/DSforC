# Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF)

The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is a federal program that was established in the 1960's to help protect natural areas, water resources, and important cultural heritage sites. It provides funds and matching grants so local, state, or the federal government can acquire land and water, or easements on land and water, and protect these places from development.

The LWCF costs taxpayers nothing. It's primarily funded by the fees paid to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement by companies that drill offshore for oil and gas. It then uses this money to fund conservation projects, protect land, and create recreation opportunites for everyone. There's LWCF-protected land and water in all 50 states - everywhere from national parks, national forests, and wildlife refuges, to local playgrounds and soccer fields.

Unfortunately, the LWCF is set to expire in September of 2018, unless Congress re-authorizes it. Additionally, Congress is supposed to fully fund the LWCF with US$900 million of the offshore drilling royalties every year, but they've consistently diverted much of this funding to other uses.
