# Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF)

The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is a federal program that was established in the 1960's to help protect natural areas, water resources, and important cultural heritage sites in the US. It provides funds and matching grants so local, state, or the federal government can acquire land and water, or easements on land and water, and protect these places from development.

The LWCF costs taxpayers nothing. It's primarily funded by the fees paid to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement by companies that drill offshore for oil and gas. It then uses this money to fund conservation projects, protect land, and create recreation opportunites for everyone. There's LWCF-protected land and water in all 50 states - everywhere from national parks, national forests, and wildlife refuges, to local playgrounds and soccer fields.

Unfortunately, the LWCF is set to expire in September of 2018, unless Congress re-authorizes it. Additionally, Congress is supposed to fully fund the LWCF with $900 million of the offshore drilling royalties every year, but they've consistently diverted much of this funding to other uses.

## LWCF Projects in New England

Below are some examples of LWCF projects specific to the New England area.

### Connecticut

**Ridgefield, CT:** In one of the largest single Land and Water Conservation Fund grants to the State of Connecticut, the 460-acre Bennett's Pond property was acquired by the Department of Environmental Protection as an expansion of the adjacent Wooster Mountain State Park in Ridgefield. Recreation in and around the pond includes fishing, hunting, hiking, mountain biking and cross-country skiing. LWCF funding assistance: $2,197,863.

**Connecticut River Watershed:** The 36,000-acre Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge encompasses the Connecticut River’s watershed from northern New Hampshire and Vermont down to Long Island Sound in Connecticut. Nearly $10 million in LWCF grants have aided in protection of land within the refuge. Additional grants have protected even more land within the 7.2-million acre watershed.

### Maine

**Washington County, ME:** Acquisition of more than 2000 acres along a 34-mile reach of the beautiful St. Croix River was led by the Land for Maine’s Future program and several private conservation organizations. The goal was to conserve a 500-foot riparian corridor for conservation and recreation, including camping, picnicking and boat access. The project completes a decade-long effort by the State of Maine, the Province of New Brunswick, the St. Croix International Waterway Commission and private land trusts to protect one of the most pristine stretches of boundary water in eastern North America. LWCF Funding Assistance: $175,000; Total Project Cost: $1,178,100. ([Source](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lwcf/upload/LWCF_ME.pdf))

### Massachusetts

**Ashburnham, MA:** Ashburnham and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts used $450,000 in LWCF funds to leverage an additional $675,000 and conserve 460 acres of forest lands along the New Hampshire border. The land provides public access for long-distance hiking, links several other conservation lands, and protects the water quality of the Millers River and preserves archaeologically sensitive sites once used by the “Harvard Shakers”. LWCF funding assistance: $450,000. ([Source](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lwcf/upload/LWCF_MA.pdf))

**Mt. Watatic, MA:** The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, through its Departments of Conservation and Recreation and Fisheries & Wildlife, joined Ashby Land Trust and the Ashburnham Conservation Trust to match the LWCF grant. The 280-acre acquisition protects scenic views from Mt. Watatic’s bald summit, wetlands and ponds and offers hiking, bird/butterfly migration viewing, hunting and skiing. The former owners of the property had proposed construction of a cell tower near the summit, which raised concerns at the local and state levels. LWCF funding assistance: $784,000.

### New Hampshire

**Tilton, NH:** A $1.3 million waterfront park is taking shape in downtown Tilton at the site of an abandoned flour mill with help from the Land and Water Conservation Fund in partnership with state and local funding and a remarkable show of community support. The 2-acre site, restored for public use by an EPA funded cleanup, will feature boat ramps, fishing piers, picnic areas and a main pavilion topped by a restored bell preserved from the mill tower. LWCF funding assistance: $100,000. ([Source](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lwcf/upload/LWCF_NH.pdf))


### Rhode Island

**Providence, RI:** More than $2 million total, from three grants, funded a series of projects to develop Roger Williams Park in downtown Providence. The 427-acre park is home to seven lakes, a zoo, a botanical garden, and other cultural sites. LWCF funding assistance: $2,272,758.

**Narragansett, RI:** One of the most popular beaches in Rhode Island, Salty Brine State Beach received an LWCF State and Local Assistance Grant to build its new pavilion. LWCF funding assistance: $1,094,865. ([Source](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58a60299ff7c508c3c05f2e1/t/5908c743e3df284d84bec1c7/1493747550938/LWCF_50thAnniversaryReport_FINAL.pdf))

### Vermont

**Black Falls Basin, VT:** In 2001, there was one last chance to secure 3764 acres along the northern corridor of Vermont’s Long Trail. Two attempts in the 1990s to acquire the Black Falls Basin had failed — the second time when Land and Water Conservation Funds were unavailable. Drawing on more than 20 public and private funding sources, including the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, the Green Mountain Club completed the largest single land acquisition it had ever undertaken. The acquisition protected a wilderness experience for Long Trail hikers and important wildlife habitat. LWCF funding assistance: $407,000.
