# Analysis of Public Comments Regarding the EPA's Revised Definition of "Waters of the United States"

In early 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order [1] requesting that agencies review a 2015 rule regarding the 'Waters of the United States'. The agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army, were instructed to rescind or replace the rule, in accordance with law.

The agencies have since conducted a reevaluation and revision of the definition of "waters of the United States". Their proposed rule redefines the scope of waters federally regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA). This rule was open for public comment until April 15, 2019.

This project aims to analyze the content of all comments available to the public.

[1] Executive Order 13778, signed on February 28, 2017, titled "Restoring the Rule of Law, Federalism, and Economic Growth by Reviewing the 'Waters of the United States' Rule"
