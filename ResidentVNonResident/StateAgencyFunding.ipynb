    "# State Agency Funding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the US, State agencies (versus Federal ones) are responsible for most wildlife management responsibilities within their borders. These agencies monitor the health of both game and non-game populations, set season dates, and determine the number of tags available to hunters. They're also responsible for land and water access programs, conservation law enforcement, and habitat improvement projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "While each State agency has different budget sources, all of them rely to some extent on the fees collected from hunting and fishing licenses, tags, and permits. This money is required to stay within the department - not go into a State's general tax fund - if said State wants to qualify for other Federal-level conservation program dollars to supplement their budgets. Such programs make up another large portion of State budgets and include the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (Pittman-Robertson Act) and the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act (Dingell-Johnson Act) among others<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some States, such as New Hampshire, receive very little funding from the General Fund. In FY2016 for example, only 2\\% of the department's \\$28 million budget was sourced from there, whereas 37\\% came from Federal programs and another 32\\% came from license sales<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a large funding onus on hunters and anglers, it's interesting to look deeper into who pays what within those license fees. One split is how much residents and non-residents of a State contribute to the total dollars collected from hunting license sales. Residents naturally pay less for licenses, tags, permits, and stamps on a per-unit basis versus what non-residents pay. And, understandably, a higher percentage of total licenses in any State go to residents as it's generally easiest for folks to hunt where they live. However, there are 15 States where, in spite of non-residents buying a lower percentage of the number of licenses, actually contributed more total dollars into the system than residents did. These states, with the percent of total license costs from non-residents generated from U.S. Fish & Wildlife Services data, are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| State | Non-Resident Contribution of Total License Costs |\n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| Colorado | 78.9\\% |\n",
    "| Wyoming | 74.4\\% |\n",
    "| Montana | 67.8\\% |\n",
    "| Kansas | 66.9\\% |\n",
    "| South Dakota | 66.1\\% |\n",
    "| New Mexico | 65.2\\% |\n",
    "| Alaska | 64.9\\% |\n",
    "| Mississippi | 63.9\\% |\n",
    "| North Dakota | 62.1\\% |\n",
    "| Idaho | 60.5\\% |\n",
    "| Arkansas | 58.3\\%|\n",
    "| West Virginia | 54.5\\% |\n",
    "| Alabama | 52.4\\% |\n",
    "| Georgia | 52.0\\% |\n",
    "| Nevada | 51.0\\% |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The detail and amount of the differences are in the analysis below. (Note that Wisconsin was removed from the 2019 data set because of suspect numbers - the trend of having 5\\% non-resident hunters in FY2018 to 76\\% one year later didn't make sense).\n",
    "\n",
    "This table isn't meant to pit resident hunters against non-resident hunters. These States clearly offer a variety of game species and the necessary access to them such that a lot of non-residents are willing to pay for those opportunities - simple supply and demand. However, if agencies have budget shortfalls and turn to increases on license fees to plug the gap, at what point are prices too high? There's always someone out there who can afford it, but what's the threshold where hunting becomes less about \"open access to all\"<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> and more \"pay to play\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguing over which hunters are covering what percent of an agency's budget is counterproductive - the bigger question is why are hunters and anglers carrying so much of the weight to fund State wildlife agencies? Yes, hunters and anglers are consumptive users - they are (usually) taking an animal or fish off the landscape. The concept that the dollars collected for this privilege later pay for conservation is what forms the basis of the U.S.'s \"user pay, user benefit\" conservation funding model. But all outdoor user groups benefit from land and water access and habitat work, and the entire population benefits from clean air, water, and a healthy ecosystem that result from proper land stewardship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other outdoor user groups are generous in donating their time, money, or professional skills to non-profits and NGOs that support the work of wildlife management agencies. These organizations help fund land acquisitions, open access points for outdoor recreation opportunities, or perform habitat stewardship work - all work that helps enable State agencies with shoestring budgets to still accomplish their missions. However, this also introduces a mix of different ideals or agendas, potentially at odds with the mission of the State agency. It seems a better approach would be to create **direct** contributions from other user groups into the State agency funds so they can operate without having to rely on third parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "A proposed \"backpack tax\" - which was a Federal-level excise tax on outdoor goods - came up a few years ago specifically to address this concern. Unfortunately, it fell through as many businesses in the outdoor industry opposed it. The industry argued that Congress should fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (which has only happened once in its existence) before it collects more taxes for conservation programs. A fair point, but unfortunately didn't help the funding situation for State agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question boils down to 'what is a fair way for other user groups to contribute'? And how can agencies better communicate how those new fees or taxes will benefit all users? Time will tell, but hopefully it doesn't take a crisis at an agency to spur change.\n",

    "The following table separates out only those States with license contributions from non-residents that make up >50% of all license costs. It also adds a cost factor column, which is the ratio of non-resident dollars to resident dollars. This represents how many times more non-residents pay into the system. For example, in CO, non-residents contribute 3.74x more than residents. In other words, for every dollar a CO resident pays in, a non-resident contributes \\$3.74."
